This project details a novel two-stage approach to image denoising that combines a ResNet-based autoencoder with a Restormer architecture. The system addresses both noise reduction and detail preservation through sequential processing stages.

The required packages are present in requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt


Test Instructions:
1. The notebook preprocess_test.ipynb can be run locally in the system to preprocess the test data.
2. The preprocessed test data and the notebook ee5179-test.ipynb can be uploaded into kaggle to obtain results for the test data.
